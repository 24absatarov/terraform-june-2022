# Why do we need local values?
# Naming and Tagging Standards
# Why do we need Tags actually? to specify, cost-allocation tags, 

# Naming Standard:
# 1. What Cloud Provider? = aws
# 2. What is the account? = non-prod, prod
# 3. What is the environment? = dev, qa, stage, prod
# 4. What is the region? = us-west-2, us-east-1
# 5. What is the project? = wordpress, matrix, apple

# How does it look?
